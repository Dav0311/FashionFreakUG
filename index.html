                <p>"You can never take too much care over the choice of your shoes. Too many women think that they are unimportant, but the real proof of an elegant woman is what is on her feet." —Christian Dior</p>
                <p>"Dress shabbily and they remember the dress; dress impeccably and they notice the woman." —Coco Chanel

                    "Perseverance and resilience are key. I also try to remain true to my vision. The idea is to create go-to pieces for a woman's wardrobe and her life—beautifully crafted pieces that a woman will love today, in two months, in two years, in five years—and to do that for as many women as possible." —Narciso Rodriguez</p>

                <p>"We all have those go-to pieces in our closet that we keep for years and literally wear out before we retire them. I'm here to make the go-tos, the keepers." —Jamie Okuma</p>
                <p>"What you wear is how you present yourself to the world, especially today, when human contacts are so quick. Fashion is instant language." —Miuccia Prada</p>
                <p>"I think we all know boldness when we see it. Nothing makes me smile more than when I see someone being fully themselves, with their own individual style and character, whatever that is." —Angelina Jolie

                    "What I really do believe is that anybody—and it really doesn't matter what shape your body is—can be seductive and sexy and gorgeous and beautiful. I use an extreme idea of beauty as a way of showing Céline, but I don't believe it has to be like that outside of the fashion show." —Phoebe Philo</p>

             <p>"Don't be into trends. Don't make fashion own you, but you decide what you are, what you want to express by the way you dress and the way to live." —Gianni Versace</p>
            
             <p>"The dress must follow the body of a woman, not the body following the shape of the dress." —Hubert de Givenchy</p>
